# Methods for Handling Outliers
There are four primary techniques discussed for handling outliers:

1. **Z-Score Treatment**
   - Identifies and removes data points based on standard deviations from the mean.

2. **IQR Filtering (Interquartile Range)**
   - Removes data points outside the range defined by the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3).

3. **Percentile Method**
   - Establishes thresholds at specific percentiles (e.g., 5th and 95th) to detect and handle outliers.
   - Two approaches:
     - **Trimming:** Directly removing outlier values.
     - **Capping/Winsorization:** Replacing extreme values with the nearest non-outlier value within the set percentile range.

4. **Winsorization**
   - Capping extreme values instead of removing them outright.
   - Alternative method to capping where extreme values are replaced with those of the nearest inliers.

## Detailed Explanation

### Percentile Method
- **Threshold Setting:** 
  - Example: Setting limits at the 5th and 95th percentiles.
  - Data points beyond these thresholds are considered outliers.
  
- **Handling Outliers:**
  - **Trimming:** Completely removes outliers from the dataset.
  - **Winsorization/Capping:** Adjusts extreme values to predefined caps (e.g., 5th and 95th percentiles), retaining all data points but limiting their influence.

### Difference Between Trimming and Winsorization
- **Trimming:** Involves directly removing the outlier values from the dataset.
- **Winsorization:** Caps extreme values rather than removing them, thus preserving the overall data structure without gaps.

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding how to use the Percentile Method effectively.
- Differentiating between trimming and winsorization.
- Practical implementation through coding exercises.
