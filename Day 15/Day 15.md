# KNN Imputer in Machine Learning

## Overview
- **KNN Imputer**: A method to fill missing values in a dataset using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
- **Applications**: Widely used in data preprocessing to handle missing data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Algorithm**: Identifies the k-nearest neighbors of a data point and uses their values to impute missing data.
- **Distance Metric**: Commonly uses Euclidean distance to find neighbors.

### 2. Imputation Techniques
- **Mean/Mode Imputation**: Fills missing values with the mean (for numerical data) or mode (for categorical data).
- **KNN Imputation**: More sophisticated, uses neighboring data points to estimate missing values.

## Steps in KNN Imputation

### Step 1: Identify Nearest Neighbors
- **Calculate Distances**: Compute the distance between the data point with missing values and all other data points.
- **Select Neighbors**: Choose the k-nearest neighbors based on the calculated distances.

### Step 2: Impute Missing Values
- **Average/Mode**: Use the average (for numerical data) or mode (for categorical data) of the selected neighbors to fill the missing value.

## Example

### Dataset
- **Features**: Age, Salary, Purchased
- **Missing Values**: Age and Salary have missing entries.

### Imputation Process
1. **Calculate Distances**:
   - Use Euclidean distance to find the nearest neighbors for the missing value in Age.
   - Example: Distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is `sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)`.

2. **Select Neighbors**:
   - Choose k=3 nearest neighbors.
   - Neighbors: (Age=28, Salary=50000), (Age=34, Salary=60000), (Age=40, Salary=70000).

3. **Impute Missing Value**:
   - Average Age of neighbors: (28 + 34 + 40) / 3 = 34.
   - Fill the missing Age with 34.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Accuracy**: Often provides more accurate imputations compared to simple mean/mode imputation.
- **Flexibility**: Can handle both numerical and categorical data.

### Disadvantages
- **Computationally Intensive**: Requires significant computational resources, especially for large datasets.
- **Time-Consuming**: Can be slow for large datasets due to the need to calculate distances for each data point.

## Real-World Applications
- **Healthcare**: Predicting patient outcomes, drug discovery.
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, risk assessment.
- **Retail**: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems.

## Conclusion
- **Effectiveness**: KNN Imputer is a powerful tool for handling missing data in various domains.
- **Future Work**: Explore optimizations and variations of the KNN algorithm to improve efficiency and accuracy.
