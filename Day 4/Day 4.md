## Framing a Machine Learning Problem
### Framing an ML problem
After verifying that your problem is best solved using her predictive ML or a
generative Al approach, you're ready to frame your problem in ML terms. You frame
a problem in ML terms by completing the following tasks:
- Define the ideal outcome and the model's goal.
- Identify the model's output.
- Define success metrics.

1. Business problem to ML problem
1. Type of problem
1. Current solution
1. Getting data
1. Metrics to measure
1. Online Vs Batch
1. Check assumptions


- Step 1: Transaction Business problem to ML problem: Increases our revenue and
decrease the churn rate.
- Step 2: Identify the problem: Identify the customers who leave the platform.
Subscription Discount | UI Not Navigate | Content Demand | Internet Issue Sentiment score
- Step 3: Current solution: Overall churn rate prediction in last year's review.
- Step 4: Getting Data: We require exact date | Watch Time | Search Result
Matching | Show Publish Date | Recommendation Click | Left Show in Middle

Combine Discuss With - data Engineering team & create a warehouse.
- Step 5: Metrix to measure: Follow checkpoints and rectify the direction of
correct Metrix.
- Step 6: Online Vs Batch ML: Focus on the training model and retraining model.
OLTP system in data warehouse setup: OLTP, or online transactional processing,
enables the real-time execution of large numbers of database transactions by
large numbers of people, typically over the internet, database transactions is a
change, insertion, deletion, or query of data in a database.
 - Step 7: Check assumptions: Check one machine learning model works as all
condition region and country.


### What is the API and how it works?
API stands for "application programming interface." An API is essentially a set of
rules that dictate how two machines talk to each other. Some examples of API-
based interactions include a cloud application communicating with a server,
servers pinging each other, or applications interacting with an operating system.
