## What is the purpose of using "Mode"?  
The **mode** is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is useful for understanding the central trend of **categorical data** in machine learning.

## What is Most Frequent (Mode) Imputation?  
Mode imputation means replacing all missing values in a column with the **most common (frequent) value** in that column.

## When to Use Mode Imputation?  
- Best suited for **categorical variables** (e.g., "Color", "Category").  
- Not ideal for numerical data; **mean** or **median** work better for numbers.  
- Use mode imputation when:  
  - Data is **missing completely at random**  
  - **Less than 5%** of values are missing  

## What is Missing Value Imputation?  
Missing value imputation fills in missing data to **preserve useful information** in the dataset, preventing data loss.
