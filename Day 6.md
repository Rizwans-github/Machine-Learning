**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is an approach to analysing data sets to summarize
their main characteristics, often with visual methods. Before applying for any ML
algorithms in data, we need to understand the data we are going to follow.
Without data understanding there will be a possibility of ML model failure. The
understanding of data is nothing but this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Exploring each data set using multiple exploratory techniques and
comparing the results is always better. Once the data set is fully understood, the data
scientist may have to go back to the data collection and cleansing phases to
transform the data set according to the desired business outcomes. The goal of this step
is to become confident that the data set is ready to be used in a machine-learning
algorithm.

TYPES OF EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
1. Univariate Analysis
2. Bivariate Analysis
3. Multivariate Analysis
### Univariate EDA 
It involves looking at a single variable at a time. Univariate EDA can help
you understand the data distribution and identify any outliers.

## Bivariate EDA 
It involves looking at two variables at a time. Bivariate EDA can help you
understand the relationship between two variables and identify any patterns that might exist.

## Multivariate EDA
It involves looking at three or more variables at a time. Multivariate
EDA can help you understand the relationships between several variables and identify
any complex patterns or outliers that might exist.
