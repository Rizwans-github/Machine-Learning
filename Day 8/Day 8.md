## What is Feature Engineering?
Feature engineering transforms raw data into useful features for predictive models.

## Missing Value Imputation
Imputed values are estimated replacements for missing data.

## Handling Categorical Values
One-hot encoding is commonly used to convert categorical data into numerical format.

## Outlier Detection
Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the dataset's average. Identifying them helps prevent skewed results.

### Detecting Outliers in Linear Regression
A scatter plot with two standard deviation lines can help identify outliers visually.

## Feature Scaling
Feature scaling normalizes the range of independent variables, ensuring balanced model training.

## Feature Construction
Combining existing features can create new, more informative ones. Example: Combining 'sibsp' and 'parent' columns in the Titanic dataset to create a 'family type' feature.

## Feature Selection
Feature selection reduces the number of input variables, lowering computational cost and improving model performance.
