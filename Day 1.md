# Machine-Learning
### What is Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a field of computer science that allows computers to learn
without being explicitly programmed. It evolved from the study of pattern recognition and
computational learning theory in artificial intelligence.
Machine learning focuses on studying algorithms that can learn from data and make
predictions (or decisions) based on models built from sample inputs.

### ML vs DL vs Al:
Al simulates human intelligence to perform tasks and make decisions. ML is a subset of Al
that uses algorithms to learn patterns from data. DL is a subset of ML that employs artificial
neural networks for complex tasks. Al may or may not require large datasets; it can use
predefined rules.

### Data Science Vs Data Analytics Vs ML/AI/DL
Data science is an umbrella term that encompasses data analytics; data mining, machine
learning, and several other related disciplines while a data scientist is expected to forecast
the future based on past patterns, data analysts extract meaningful insights from various
data sources.

### Types of machine learning
#### What are the 4 types of machine learning?
There are four types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, semi-supervised,
unsupervised and reinforcement.
<br></br>
#### What are the 3 types of machine learning?
Machine learning involves showing a large volume of data to a machine so that it can learn
and make predictions, find patterns, or classify data. The three machine learning types
are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
<br></br>
Type of machine learning
1. Supervised ML : Regression, Classification
2. Unsupervised ML : Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, Association Rule Learning
3. Semi-supervised ML
4. Reinforcement ML

#### Supervised Machine Learning:
Supervised learning is defined as when a model gets trained on a "Labelled Dataset".
Labelled datasets have both input and output parameters. In Supervised Learning
algorithms learn to map points between inputs and correct outputs. It has both
training and validation datasets labelled.

#### Advantages of Supervised Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning models can have high accuracy as they are trained on
labelled data.
- The process of decision-making in supervised learning models is often
interpretable.
- It can often be used in pre-trained models which saves time and resources when
developing new models from scratch.
#### Disadvantages of Supervised Machine Learning
- It has limitations in knowing patterns and may struggle with unseen or
unexpected patterns that are not present in the training data.
- It can be time-consuming and costly as it relies on labelled data only.
- It may lead to poor generalizations based on new data.
#### Applications of Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is used in a wide variety of applications, including:
- Image classification: Identify objects, faces, and other features in images.
- Natural language processing: Extract information from text, such as sentiment, entities, and relationships.
- Speech recognition: Convert spoken language into text.
- Recommendation systems: Make personalized recommendations to users.
- Predictive analytics: Predict outcomes, such as sales, customer churn, and stock prices.
- Medical diagnosis: Detect diseases and other medical conditions.
- Fraud detection: Identify fraudulent transactions.
- Autonomous vehicles: Recognize and respond to objects in the environment.
- Email spam detection: Classify emails as spam or not spam.
- Quality control in manufacturing: Inspect products for defects.
- Credit scoring: Assess the risk of a borrower defaulting on a loan.
- Gaming: Recognize characters, analyze player behaviour, and create NPCs.
- Customer support: Automate customer support tasks.
- Weather forecasting: Make predictions for temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological parameters.
- Sports analytics: Analyse player performance, make game predictions, and optimize strategies.

  ### Unsupervised Machine Learning:
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning technique in which an algorithm
discovers patterns and relationships using unlabelled data. Unlike supervised
learning, unsupervised learning doesn't involve providing the algorithm with labelled
target outputs. The primary goal of Unsupervised learning is often to discover hidden
patterns, similarities, or clusters within the data, which can then be used for various
purposes, such as data exploration, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and
more.
#### Two main categories of unsupervised learning are mentioned below:
1. Clustering
2. Dimensionality Reduction
(3. Anomaly Detection & 4. Association Rule Learning)
##### Unsupervised Learning algorithms:
Below is the list of some popular unsupervised learning algorithms.
- K-means clustering
- KNN (k-nearest neighbours)
- Hierarchal clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Neural Networks
- Principle Component Analysis
- Independent Component Analysis
- Singular value decomposition

#### Advantages of Unsupervised Machine Learning
- It helps to discover hidden patterns and various relationships between the data.
- Used for tasks such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data exploration.
- It does not require labelled data and reduces the effort of data labelling.
#### Disadvantages of Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Without using labels, it may be difficult to predict the quality of the model's output.
- Cluster Interpretability may not be clear and may not have meaningful interpretations.
- It has techniques such as autoencoders and dimensionality reduction that can be used to extract meaningful features from raw data.

#### Applications of Unsupervised Learning
Here are some common applications of unsupervised learning:
- Clustering: Group similar data points into clusters.
- Anomaly detection: Identify outliers or anomalies in data.
- Dimensionality reduction: Reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving its essential information.
- Recommendation systems: Suggest products, movies, or content to users based on their historical behaviour or preferences.
- Topic modelling: Discover latent topics within a collection of documents.
- Density estimation: Estimate the probability density function of data.
- Image and video compression: Reduce the amount of storage required for multimedia content.
- Data pre-processing: Help with data pre-processing tasks such as data cleaning, imputation of missing values, and data scaling.
- Market basket analysis: Discover associations between products.
- Genomic data analysis: Identify pattern or group genes with similar expression profiles.
- Image segmentation: Segment images into meaningful regions.
- Community detection in social networks. Identify communities or groups of individuals with similar interests or connections.
- Customer behaviour analysis: Uncover patterns and insights for better marketing and product recommendations.
- Content recommendation: Classify and tag content to make it easier to recommend similar items to users.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Explore data and gain insights before defining specific tasks.

#### There are 4 main categories of unsupervised learning:

1. Clustering
2. Dimensionality Reduction
3. Anomaly Detection
4. Association Rule Learning

###### Clustering:
It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.
<br></br>

###### Dimensionality Reduction: 
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the
number of features (or dimensions) in a dataset while retaining as much information
as possible.

###### Anomaly Detection:
Anomaly detection in machine learning is the process of
identifying such anomalies in a dataset. Anomaly detection is an important technique
in machine learning and data mining, as it can be used to detect unusual behaviour,
identify errors, and discover new insights in large datasets.

###### Association Rule Learning
Association rule mining is a technique used to uncover hidden relationships between
variables in large datasets.
#### Semi-supervised machine learning: (Partially Supervised√•nd Un Supervised)
We want to ignore labelling because it's very costly that's why we use "Semi-supervised machine learning"
<br></br>
<img height="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c832877-f5b3-4591-bacf-7fa072f137f2">
#### Reinforcement machine learning: 
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training methods based on rewarding desired behaviours and punishing
undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent -- the entity being
trained -- is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn
through trial and error.
