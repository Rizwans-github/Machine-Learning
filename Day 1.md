# Machine Learning Overview

### What is Machine Learning?
A branch of computer science where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

### ML vs DL vs AI
- **AI:** Mimics human intelligence with rules or learned data.  
- **ML:** A subset of AI that learns from data.  
- **DL:** A subset of ML using neural networks for complex tasks.

### Data Science vs Data Analytics vs ML/AI/DL
- **Data Science:** Umbrella term including data mining, analytics, and predictive modeling.  
- **Data Analytics:** Focused on extracting insights from data.  
- **ML/AI/DL:** Techniques for forecasting, automating, and optimizing tasks.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised:** Trains on labeled data (regression, classification).  
2. **Unsupervised:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, association rule learning).  
3. **Semi-supervised:** Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.  
4. **Reinforcement:** Learns through trial and error via rewards and penalties.

### Supervised Learning
**Definition:**  
Trains models on labeled datasets to map inputs to outputs.

**Pros:**  
- High accuracy  
- Interpretability  
- Reusability via pre-trained models

**Cons:**  
- Requires costly labeled data  
- May not generalize to unseen patterns

**Applications:**  
Image classification, NLP, speech recognition, recommendation systems, predictive analytics, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, autonomous vehicles, spam filtering, quality control, credit scoring, gaming, customer support, weather forecasting, sports analytics.

### Unsupervised Learning
**Definition:**  
Discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

**Techniques:**  
- Clustering: Grouping similar data  
- Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data features  
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers  
- Association Rule Learning: Finding relationships between variables

**Pros:**  
- Discovers unknown patterns  
- No need for labeled data

**Cons:**  
- Uncertain output quality and interpretability

**Applications:**  
Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, recommendation systems, topic modeling, image/video compression, market basket analysis, genomic analysis, image segmentation, social network analysis, exploratory data analysis.
