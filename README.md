Here are some of the key topics I covered:

- **Web Scraping and Data Fetching using APIs**
  - Techniques for extracting data from websites and APIs.
- **Panda Profiling and Feature Engineering**
  - Methods for analyzing and transforming data to improve model performance.
- **Imputation Techniques**
  - Handling missing data using various imputation methods:
    - Complete Case Analysis
    - Mean/Median Imputation
    - Categorical Imputation
    - KNN Imputer
- **Outlier Detection Techniques**
  - Identifying and handling outliers in datasets.
- **Data Visualization**
  - Creating graphs and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
